## What This Will Be

**Castle of Shadows** is a dark-humorous, 80s-style text adventure game built as a portable Django module. Players navigate a mysterious castle, solving puzzles, collecting items, and making choices that significantly alter the story. The game features ASCII art visualizations, a save system, and multiple endings based on player decisions.

**Inspired by classic 80s text adventures** with a modern web framework, this project captures the nostalgia of games like Castle Adventure, Zork, and Colossal Cave Adventure‚Äîbut with a darkly comedic twist.
