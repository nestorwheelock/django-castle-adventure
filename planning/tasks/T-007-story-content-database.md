# T-007: Story Content Database Population

**Related Story:** S-006 (Story Content Implementation)
**Priority:** P0 Critical
**Estimate:** 6 hours
**Sprint:** Sprint 2 & 3
**Status:** Pending

---

## AI Coding Brief

**Role:** Content Writer + Backend Developer
**Objective:** Write all 28 scene descriptions, create database fixtures, and populate story content

**User Request:** "Write all story scenes, items, choices, and endings then load them into the database"

---

## Constraints

### Allowed File Paths
- `castle_adventure/fixtures/` (new directory)
- `castle_adventure/fixtures/scenes.json`
- `castle_adventure/fixtures/choices.json`
- `castle_adventure/fixtures/items.json`
- `castle_adventure/fixtures/endings.json`
- `castle_adventure/management/commands/load_story_content.py`
- `castle_adventure/tests/test_content.py`

### Forbidden Paths
- No ASCII art yet (that's T-008)

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Scene Content (28 scenes)

**Use story-graph.md as reference. Create JSON fixtures:**

```json
[
  {
    "model": "castle_adventure.scene",
    "pk": 1,
    "fields": {
      "scene_id": "01",
      "title": "Outside Castle Walls",
      "description": "Dark, stormy night. Castle Shadowmere looms ominously before you...",
      "scene_type": "story",
      "is_ending": false,
      "is_death": false,
      "ascii_art": ""
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

**All 28 scenes from story-graph.md:**
- 21 story scenes (01-23)
- 6 death scenes (D1-D8)
- 5 ending scenes (E1-E5)

### 2. Choice Content (~85 choices)

```json
[
  {
    "model": "castle_adventure.choice",
    "pk": 1,
    "fields": {
      "from_scene": 1,  # Scene 01
      "to_scene": 2,    # Scene 02
      "choice_text": "Climb the garden wall (stealthy)",
      "choice_letter": "A",
      "requires_item": null,
      "order": 1
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

### 3. Item Content (8 items)

```json
[
  {
    "model": "castle_adventure.item",
    "pk": 1,
    "fields": {
      "item_id": "ITEM_001",
      "name": "Magic Spectacles",
      "description": "Dusty spectacles that reveal what eyes cannot see...",
      "found_in_scene": 13,  # Troll's Lair
      "is_critical": true,
      "is_consumable": false,
      "is_trap": false,
      "icon": "üîÆ"
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

### 4. Ending Content (5 endings)

```json
[
  {
    "model": "castle_adventure.ending",
    "pk": 1,
    "fields": {
      "ending_id": "E1",
      "title": "Heroic Rescue",
      "description": "Princess Elara carefully evaluates you...",
      "ending_type": "victory",
      "icon": "‚≠ê",
      "achievement_text": "The classic ending. Well done!",
      "is_secret": false,
      "requirements": {}
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

### 5. Management Command to Load Content

```python
# management/commands/load_story_content.py
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand
from django.core.management import call_command

class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = 'Load all story content from fixtures'

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        self.stdout.write('Loading story content...')

        call_command('loaddata', 'scenes')
        call_command('loaddata', 'choices')
        call_command('loaddata', 'items')
        call_command('loaddata', 'endings')

        self.stdout.write(self.style.SUCCESS('Story content loaded successfully!'))
```
