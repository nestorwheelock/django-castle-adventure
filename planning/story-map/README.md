# Story Map: Castle of Shadows

**Project:** django-castle-adventure v1.0.0
**Genre:** Dark-Humorous Text Adventure
**Setting:** Cursed Medieval Castle
**Era:** 80s-style classic adventure

---

## World Overview

### The Castle of Shadows

Once a proud fortress of the royal family, Castle Shadowmere fell to darkness when the King accepted a cursed artifact from a traveling merchant. Now the castle is a labyrinth of deadly traps, supernatural horrors, and twisted logic. The Princess is imprisoned in the tower, and only the bravest (or most foolish) adventurer would dare attempt a rescue.

**The castle doesn't play by normal rules.** Doors lock behind you. Rooms rearrange. The troll in the dungeon collects riddles instead of gold. The dragon is afraid of mice. The wizard has terrible eyesight and might mistake you for the pizza delivery. Death is common, but at least the castle has a dark sense of humor about it.

### Tone & Style

**Dark Humor Examples:**
- "You died. Again. The castle is now selling commemorative T-shirts with your face on them."
- "The dragon sneezes, incinerating three tapestries and a very surprised bat. 'Sorry,' it mumbles."
- "The troll's riddle: 'What has four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and is currently bleeding out in my dungeon?' You decide not to answer."

**Writing Principles:**
- Death is frequent but comically presented
- NPCs have unexpected quirks (cowardly dragon, polite troll, blind wizard)
- Puzzle solutions are logical but twisted
- Success feels earned, failure feels darkly amusing
- Medieval setting with anachronistic humor (no modern references, but absurd situations)

## Story Structure

### Funnel Architecture

The story uses a "funnel" branching structure to prevent exponential path explosion:

```
         START
           |
    [Early Branches] (3-4 paths)
           |
           ↓
    [CONVERGENCE POINT]
           |
    [Mid Branches] (2-3 paths)
           |
           ↓
    [CONVERGENCE POINT]
           |
    [Final Branches] (3-5 endings)
```

**Benefits:**
- Player feels agency (choices matter)
- Manageable content creation (not 100+ unique scenes)
- Multiple playthroughs reveal different content
- Critical path ensures progress

### Critical Path (MVP Playthrough)

**The "Smart Adventurer" Path:**
1. Climb garden wall
2. Evade hounds across courtyard
3. Drop drawbridge gate (trap hounds)
4. Enter castle through main gate
5. Explore throne room (find first clue)
6. Descend to dungeon (solve troll's riddle)
7. Obtain magic spectacles from troll
8. Find invisible ink message in library
9. Message reveals tower key location
10. Obtain dragon's flame from sleeping dragon
11. Use flame to melt ice blocking tower stairs
12. Climb tower to princess's chamber
13. Free princess with tower key
14. ENDING: Heroic Rescue

**Estimated playthrough time:** 10-15 minutes
**Total scenes in critical path:** ~15 scenes

### Alternate Paths

**The "Reckless Adventurer" Path:**
- Fight hounds instead of evade (bad choice, leads to death or escape)
- Kill troll instead of riddles (miss spectacles, harder path)
- Wake dragon instead of sneak (combat or flee, risky)

**The "Clever Trickster" Path:**
- Bribe wizard for information
- Use royal seal to command guards
- Find secret passage bypassing dungeon
- Talk dragon into helping (dragon afraid of mice, you find mice)

**The "Doomed Fool" Path:**
- Make all wrong choices
- Die entertainingly
- Easter egg endings for creative failures

## Convergence Points

To prevent path explosion, stories converge at these critical hubs:

**Convergence 1: Castle Entrance Hall (Scene 5)**
- All "get inside castle" paths lead here
- Regardless of how you evaded hounds, you're now inside

**Convergence 2: Grand Hallway (Scene 9)**
- Central hub connecting all exploration areas
- All characters eventually find this area
- From here, branch to library/dungeon/dragon/wizard

**Convergence 3: Tower Staircase (Scene 19)**
- All paths that survived Act II lead here
- Must have dragon's flame (or alternative) to proceed
- Final convergence before ending branches

**Path:** Completed all puzzles correctly, found princess, escape together
**Tone:** Classic happy ending... with a twist
**Description:** "You and Princess Elara escape the castle as it begins to crumble. 'Not bad,' she admits. 'Though I had a much more elegant escape plan.' You're not sure if she's joking. The castle collapses behind you. She is definitely not joking about being unimpressed."

### Ending 2: Tragic Betrayal 🗡️
**Requirements:** Arrived at tower without Royal Seal OR killed NPCs along the way
**Path:** Princess sees you as just another brute, betrays you
**Tone:** Dark twist
**Description:** "Princess Elara smiles as you enter. 'My hero,' she says, right before pushing you off the balcony. 'Nothing personal. The curse requires a sacrifice, and you're very sacrificial-looking.' You have a long time to contemplate your poor choice in rescue missions on the way down."

### Ending 3: Mutual Escape 🤝
**Requirements:** Royal Seal obtained, convinced NPCs to help, showed cleverness
**Path:** Princess respects you, you work together to escape
**Tone:** Partnership ending
**Description:** "Princess Elara grabs the rope you prepared. 'You're smarter than you look,' she says. Together you navigate the secret passage she found and the escape route you prepared. The castle's curse is broken, and the dragon waves goodbye from his cave. 'Thank you for removing those dreadful mice!'"

### Ending 4: Castle Collapse (Bonus) 💥
**Requirements:** Made chaotic choices, broke many things, woke the dragon violently
**Path:** Destroyed so much the castle can't maintain itself
**Tone:** Chaotic comedy
**Description:** "The castle, having endured centuries of dark magic, could not endure you. The walls crumble. The dragon flees. The troll evacuates with his riddle collection. Princess Elara escapes in the chaos, stealing a horse and shouting 'Thanks for the distraction, idiot!' You're buried in rubble but somehow survive. The local tavern names a drink after you: 'The Castle Destroyer.'"

### Ending 5: Become the New Ruler (Bonus) 👑
**Requirements:** Collect ALL items, convince ALL NPCs, sit on cursed throne
**Path:** Hidden secret ending
**Tone:** Ironic twist

Princess Elara shrugs and leaves to become an adventurer herself. You're now stuck ruling a crumbling castle full of anxious dragons and polite trolls. The wizard still thinks you're the pizza delivery. This is your life now. Congratulations?"

## Design Patterns & Principles

### Story Consistency Rules

1. **Medieval Fantasy Logic** - No modern technology, but absurd medieval situations are fine
2. **Death is Common** - Player dies frequently, but it's presented humorously
3. **NPCs Have Depth** - Even minor NPCs have personality quirks
4. **Puzzles Are Fair** - Clues available through exploration
5. **Choices Matter** - Different paths lead to meaningfully different content
6. **Dark but Not Cruel** - Humor comes from absurdity, not meanness

### Writing Standards

**Scene Descriptions:** 3-5 sentences, atmospheric but concise
**Choice Text:** <50 characters, clear consequences
**Tone:** Darkly humorous, self-aware, slightly absurd
**ASCII Art:** 10-20 lines, evocative not realistic

### Scene Template

```
SCENE_ID: XX
TITLE: [Location Name]

DESCRIPTION:
[3-5 sentences describing location, atmosphere, immediate situation]

CHOICES:
A) [Action choice] → Scene YY
B) [Action choice] → Scene ZZ (requires ITEM_NAME)
C) [Action choice] → DEATH_SCENE_AA
D) [Return to previous area] → Scene WW

ITEMS_HERE: [Item names if any]
NPCS_HERE: [NPC names if any]
ASCII_ART: [Reference to art file]
```

## Accessibility & User Guidance

### How Players Learn Mechanics

1. **Tutorial Scene (Scene 01):** Introduces choice-making, describes controls
2. **Inventory Prompts:** "You found [ITEM]! It has been added to your inventory."
3. **Locked Choice Feedback:** "You need [ITEM] to choose this option."
4. **Save Reminders:** "Your progress has been saved automatically."
5. **Death Screens:** Explain what went wrong humorously

### Hints Without Handholding

- NPCs provide cryptic clues in dialogue
- Scene descriptions mention relevant details
- Item descriptions hint at uses
- Wrong choices give feedback before death
- Multiple attempts encouraged (save system supports experimentation)

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed story graph (story-graph.md)
2. Write all scene descriptions (main-arc.md, side-branches.md)
3. Define all endings (endings.md)
4. Map items to scenes (content-inventory.md)
5. Generate user stories from story structure
6. Proceed with wireframes and task breakdown
